## Mathematics Problems
Equations, algorithms and fractals

Above you'll find a selection of mathematics problems which I have found and 
solved for personal enjoyment (and hopefully now yours!) along my journey of 
learning how to use Python. To run, execute

```
python filename.py
```

in your chosen terminal, be sure to be in the right directory.
